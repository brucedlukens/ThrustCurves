fix: address manual testing feedback on Phase 4/5 UI

Bug fixes:
- WeightEditor: use local string state so user can type negative values
  without the controlled number input snapping back to 0
- GearRatioEditor/AeroEditor: always show stock value (not empty) so
  spinner arrows increment from correct baseline instead of 0
- TireSizeEditor: always write all three fields to avoid partial TireSize
  state that caused NaN-propagation crash in chart tooltip; show outer
  diameter (in / mm) instead of notation string
- ThrustCurveChart: defensive tooltip label/formatter for non-finite values

Features:
- GearRatioEditor: add shift time override input (ms) to Drivetrain section
- TorqueCurveEditor: add custom torque curve table for entering dyno data;
  pre-populated from stock curve, editable RPM/Nm rows with add/remove
- TractionEditor: new component with longitudinal grip limit (mu) and
  presets (Drag/Track/Street/Eco); capped in physics engine via
  mu x mass x g before envelope/shift-point computation
- types/config.ts: add tractionCoefficientMu field to CarModifications
- engine/index.ts: apply traction limit in runSimulation after gear curves
